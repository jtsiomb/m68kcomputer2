Design notes
============

Memory map
----------

potential decoding schemes:
  - top 2 bits:	4 1gb blocks
  - top 3 bits:	8 512mb blocks
  - top 4 bits:	16 256mb blocks
  - top 5 bits:	32 128mb blocks
  - top 6 bits:	64 64mb blocks
  - top 7 bits:	128 32mb blocks

00000000 - 01ffffff (0-64M)	ROM
02000000 - 07ffffff (64M-128M)	I/O space
08000000 - ffffffff (128M-4G)	RAM


Interrupts
----------
6 IRQs + NMI go through the priority encoder, which outpus the correct IPL
signals to the processor.

The interrupt acknowledge cycle is signalled by function code 7 (CPU space) and
address bits A16-A19 all set (0xf). /FCPU is asserted by NANDing the FC signals,
which is fed to the GAL along with the address lines and the address strobe
(/AS), to assert /IACK.

During IACK, address lines A1-A3 contain the interrupt level (inv of IPL), which
can be used to route IACK to the correct device.

Next steps:
   - IACK should be fed back to the interrupting device to trigger user
     vectoring followed by DSACK, or autovectoring, depending on the device.
   - IACK should reset the BERR watchdog counter to signal spurious interrupt
     after a number of cycles.

DMA
---

Device asserts /BR (bus request), waits for /BG (bus grant), waits for /AS,
/DSACK, and /BGACK to be released, and responds by asserting /BGACK and holding
it for as long as it needs to remain bus master.  See MC68030UM section 7.7.
